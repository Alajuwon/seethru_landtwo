								<h2 class="address">Problem</h2>
								<p class="description">
								Health care costs and quality are notoriously opaque. Healthcare is the only industry not driven by consumer choice. Today, consumers of U.S. healthcare don’t have the tools to make value-based decisions. </p>

								<p class="description">In addition, providers never know how much and when they will get paid for their services. It can often take 90-120 days before receiving compensation. Working with insurance companies and collection agencies is a true pain point and financial burden.</p>
								
							</div>

						<div class="col-md-6">
							<h2 class="address">Solution</h2>
							<p class="description">
							SeeThru provides a platform that makes healthcare pricing and quality transparent. Using our proprietary approach, patients will search, book, and pay for the care they need with clarity and ease. Consumers will review their care and own their health records.</p> 

							<p class="description"> SeeThru allows healthcare providers to receive payment instantly at a price they set dramatically shortening billing cycles and reducing administrative expenses. </p>

						Last year Americans spent over $338 BILLION on out-of-pocket health costs and this number is increasing by 5% annually. It no longer makes sense to spend so much on healthcare and get very little in return.</p>

								<h3 class="skill">Know More</h3>
								<p class="description">
									Over 75% of healthcare consumers say it's important or very important that they know their costs before treatment, and 53 percent want to discuss financing options before care.
